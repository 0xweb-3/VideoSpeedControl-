## Permission Explanations

### üì¶ Why do you need the "storage" permission?
This extension uses the storage permission to save user's personalized settings, including custom keyboard shortcut time intervals (seconds for Z, X, C, V keys) and user's language preference (Chinese/English/Auto-detect). All settings data is stored locally on the user's device and is never uploaded to any external servers, ensuring user privacy and security.

### üéØ Why do you need the "activeTab" permission?
This extension requires activeTab permission to detect HTML5 video elements on the current webpage, apply playback speed control (1x, 1.5x, 2x, 2.5x, 3x) to detected videos, and respond to user keyboard shortcuts for video skip forward/backward functionality. This permission only activates when users actively operate the extension and does not access webpage content in the background.

### üìë Why do you need the "tabs" permission?
This extension uses tabs permission to synchronize user settings across multiple browser tabs, ensuring that when users adjust playback speed in the extension popup, the speed settings can be applied to the corresponding video tabs. This permission is not used to collect user browsing history or personal information, only for normal extension functionality.

### üåê Why do you need host permissions?
This extension requests permission to run on all websites to provide unified speed control functionality on any website containing video content, supporting mainstream video platforms as well as educational and news websites. The extension only operates on pages with detected video elements and does not collect, store, or transmit any webpage content or user data.

### üíª Are you using remote code?
Selected: **No, I am not using remote code**

All JavaScript code in this extension is packaged within the extension files and does not rely on any external CDN or remote server code. All functionality runs in the user's local environment, ensuring complete offline operation, transparent and auditable code, secure user data with no external transmission.
